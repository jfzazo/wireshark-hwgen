=== Major API Changes

The libwireshark API has undergone some major changes:

* The emem framework (including all ep_ and se_ memory allocation routines) has
been completely removed in favour of wmem which is now fully mature.
* The (long-since-broken) Python bindings support has been removed.  If
you want to write dissectors in something other than C, use Lua.


== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
