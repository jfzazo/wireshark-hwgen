== Quick Setup

[[ChSetupUNIX]]

=== UNIX: Installation

All the tools required are usually installed on a UNIX developer machine.

If a tool is not already installed on your system, you can usually install it
using the package in your distribution: aptitude, yum, Synaptic, etc.

If an install package is not available or you have a
reason not to use it (maybe because it's simply too old), you
can install that tool from source code. The following sections
will provide you with the webpage addresses where you can get
these sources.

[[ChSetupWin32]]

=== Win32/64: Step-by-Step Guide

A quick setup guide for Win32 and Win64 with recommended
configuration.

[WARNING]
====
Unless you know exactly what you are doing, you
should strictly follow the recommendations below.
====

[[ChSetupPowerShell]]

==== Install PowerShell

PowerShell 2.0 or later is required for building Wireshark and the NSIS package.
Windows 7 and later include compatible versions. It is also required by
Chocolatey.

If you are running Windows Vista and have thus far managed to not install
PowerShell 2.0, either directly or via anything that requires it, you must now
install PowerShell 2.0. You can download it from
https://www.microsoft.com/powershell[]

[[ChSetupChocolatey]]

==== Optional: Install Chocolatey

https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey] is a native package manager for Windows.
There are https://chocolatey.org/packages[packages] for most of the software
listed below. Along with traditional Windows packages it supports Cygwin and
and the Python Package Index.

// ...such as:
// - Active Perl and/or StrawberryPerl
// - Devbox-UnZip and/or 7zip and/or peazip
// - Wget
// - Git (a native win32 (MSYS) version)

[[ChSetupMSVC]]

==== Install Microsoft C compiler and SDK

You need to install, in exactly this order:

. C compiler:
http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9863608[Download]
and install "Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition." This is a small download that then downloads all the other required parts (which are quite large).

Uncheck all the optional components (unless you want to use them for purposes other than Wireshark).

You can use Chocolatey to install Visual Studio:

----
PS$>choco install VisualStudioCommunity2013
----

[TIP]
.You can use other Microsoft C compiler variants, but VS2013 is used
to build the development releases and is the preferred option.
====
It's possible to compile Wireshark with a wide range
of Microsoft C compiler variants. For details see
<<ChToolsMSChain>>!

For VS2013 (and later) Microsoft has left out a required file from the
include files to build with nmake.  To fix this copy Win32.Mak from the Win 7 SDK
into an appropriate path for use with VS2013, e.g.
----
xcopy C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1A\Include\Win32.Mak C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\include
----
====


[WARNING]
.Don't use gcc or Clang
====
Compiling with gcc or Clang is not recommended and will
certainly not work (at least without a lot of advanced
tweaking). For further details on this topic, see
<<ChToolsGNUChain>>.
====
// XXX This is changing in regard to Clang:
// http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStartedVS.html

// XXX - mention the compiler and PSDK web installers -
// which significantly reduce download size - and find out the
// required components

Why is this recommended? While this is a huge download,
Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition is the only free (as in beer)
versions that includes the Visual Studio integrated
debugger. Visual Studio 2013 is also used to create official
Wireshark builds, so it will likely have fewer development-related
problems.

For VS2010 You will need some extra items:

. Windows SDK for Windows 7, if you want to build 64-bit binaries for Windows 7:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx[Download] and
install "Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7."
+
In case the install of the SDK fails go to software management and
remove the $$VC++$$ 2010 runtime and redist packages (don't worry, they
will be added back via the service pack later). If installation of
the SDK still fails, there may be a permission problem. See
http://ctrlf5.net/?p=184[here] for a solution.

. C compiler service pack:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691[Download] and
install "Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1." This is a very large
download.

. Microsoft Visual $$C++$$ 2010 Service Pack 1 Compiler Update for the Windows
SDK 7.1, if you want to build 64-bit binaries for Windows 7:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4422[Download] and
install "Microsoft Visual $$C++$$ 2010 Service Pack 1 Compiler Update for the
Windows SDK 7.1."

. If you will be building 64-bit binaries those items must be
installed in that order as installing the Microsoft Visual Studio
2010 Service Pack 1 can, if you've installed the Microsoft Windows
SDK for Windows 7, remove the 64-bit compilers, as per
http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2519277[] the Microsoft Knowledge Base article "FIX: Visual C++ compilers are removed when you upgrade Visual Studio 2010 Professional or Visual Studio 2010 Express to Visual Studio 2010 SP1 if Windows SDK v7.1 is installed".  The release notes for the Microsoft Visual
$$C++$$ 2010 Service Pack 1 Compiler Update for the Windows SDK 7.1
say that, to ensure that your system has a supported
configuration, you must install the items in the order specified
above.  If you have Microsoft Update installed, so that the
Windows update process will update software other than components
of Windows, and thus will update Visual Studio, you may need to
disable it until after all of the above are installed, to make
sure it doesn't install Visual Studio 2010 SP1 out of order.

[[ChSetupQt]]

==== Install Qt

The main Wireshark application uses the Qt windowing toolkit. To install Qt
download the *Online Installer* from the Qt Project
http://qt-project.org/downloads[download page] and select a component that
matches your target system and compiler. For example, the ``msvc2013 64-bit
OpenGL'' component is used to build the official 64-bit packages.

Note that the Qt package also includes the Qt Creator IDE, which is useful
for designing graphical components and includes an interactive debugger.
You'll need to build Wireshark using nmake before you'll be able to build the
Wireshark project (uiqtWireshark.pro), however.

You can also use Chocolatey to install Qt (there are packages for x86 & x64 and various MSVC compilers, e.g.

----
PS$>choco install qt-sdk-windows-x86-msvc2013_opengl
----

[[ChSetupCygwin]]

==== Install Cygwin

On 32-bit Windows, http://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe[download the
32-bit Cygwin installer] and start it.  On 64-bit Windows,
http://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe[download the 64-bit Cygwin
installer] and start it.

At the "Select Packages" page, you'll need to select
some additional packages which are not installed by default.
Navigate to the required Category/Package row and, if the package
has a "Skip" item in the "New" column, click on the "Skip" item
so it shows a version number for:

// Only used by win-setup.sh
* Archive/unzip

* Devel/bison (or install Win flex-bison - see Chocolatey below)

* Devel/flex (or install Win flex-bison - see Chocolatey below)

* Devel/git (recommended - see discussion about using Git below)

* Interpreters/perl

* Utils/patch (only if needed) (may be Devel/patch instead)

// Only used by win-setup.sh
* Web/wget

* asciidoc

// Also need: bash/sh, sed

You might also have to install

* Interpreters/m4

if installing Devel/bison doesn't provide a working version of Bison. If
m4 is missing bison will fail.

After clicking the Next button several times, the setup
will then download and install the selected packages (this
may take a while).

Why is this recommended? Cygwin's bash version is required, as no native Win32
version is available. As additional packages can easily be added, Perl and
other packages are also used.

Alternatively you can install Cygwin and its packages using Chocolatey:

----
PS$>choco install cygwin
PS$>choco install cyg-get
PS$>choco install unzip wget asciidoc [...] -source cygwin
----

Chocolatey installs Cygwin in 'C:\tools\cygwin' by default.

[[ChSetupPython]]

==== Install Python

Get the Python 2.7 installer from http://python.org/download/[] and install
Python into the default location ('C:\Python27').

Why is this recommended? Cygwin's Python package doesn't work on some machines,
so the Win32 native package is recommended (and it's faster).  Note that Python 3.x isn't currently supported.

Alternatively you can install Python using Chocolatey:

----
PS$>choco install python2
----

Chocolatey installs Python 2 in 'C:\tools\python2' by default.

[[ChSetupsubversion]]

==== Install Git

Please note that the following is not required to build Wireshark but can be
quite helpful when working with the sources.

Working with the Git source repositories is highly recommended, see
<<ChSrcObtain>>. It is much easier to update a personal source tree (local repository) with Git
rather than downloading a zip file and merging new sources into a personal
source tree by hand. It also makes first-time setup easy and enables the
Wireshark build process to determine your current source code revision.

There are several ways in which Git can be installed. Most packages are
available at the URLs below or via https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey].
Note that many of the GUI interfaces depend on the command line version.

===== The Official Windows Installer

The official command-line installer is available at http://msysgit.github.io/.

===== Git Extensions

Git Extensions is a native Windows graphical Git client for
Windows.  You can download the installer from
http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/.

===== TortoiseGit

TortoiseGit is a native Windows graphical Git
similar to TortoiseSVN. You can download the installer from
http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/.

===== Command Line client via Chocolatey

The command line client can be installed (and updated) using Chocolatey:
----
PS$> choco install git
----

===== Others

A list of other GUI interfaces for Git can be found at
http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis

==== Install and Prepare Sources

[TIP]
.Make sure everything works
====
It's a good idea to make sure Wireshark compiles and runs at least once before
you start hacking the Wireshark sources for your own project. This example uses
Git Extensions but any other Git client should work as well.
====

// XXX -

*Download sources* Download Wireshark sources into
'C:\Development\wireshark' using either the command line or Git Extensions:

Using the command line:

----
>cd C:\Development
>git clone https://code.wireshark.org/review/wireshark
----

Using Git extensions:

. Open the Git Extensions application. By default Git Extensions
   will show a validation checklist at startup. If anything needs to
   be fixed do so now. You can bring up the checklist at any time
   via _Tools -> Settings_.

. In the main screen select _Clone repository_. Fill in the following:
+
Repository to clone: `https://code.wireshark.org/review/wireshark`
+
Destination: Your top-level development directory, e.g. `C:\Development`.
+
Subdirectory to create: Anything you'd like. Usually `wireshark`.
+
[TIP]
.Check your paths
====
Make sure your repository path doesn't contain spaces.
====

. Click the _Clone_ button. Git Extensions should start cloning the
   Wireshark repository.

[[ChSetupPrepareCommandCom]]

==== Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt

From the Start Menu (or Start Screen), navigate to the Visual Studio 2013 ->
Visual Studio Tools directory and choose the Command Prompt appropriate for
the build you wish to make, e.g. VS2013 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for a 32 bit version.

[TIP]
.Pin the items to the Task Bar
====
Pin the Command Prompt you use to the Task Bar for easy access.
====

All subsequent operations take place in this Command Prompt window.

. Set environment variables to control the build.
+
--
Set the following environment variables, using paths and values suitable for your installation:

----
> set CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning
> set WIRESHARK_BASE_DIR=C:\Development
> set WIRESHARK_TARGET_PLATFORM=win32 or win64 as required
> set QT5_BASE_DIR=C:\Qt\Qt5.3.0\5.3\msvc2013

> set WIRESHARK_VERSION_EXTRA=-YourExtraVersionInfo
----
If you are using a version of Visual Studio earlier than VS2012 then you must set an additional env var,
e.g. for VS2010 set the following:
----
> set VisualStudioVersion=10.0
----
Setting these variables could be added to a batch file to be run after you open
the Visual Studio Tools Command Prompt.
--

. Change to the correct source directory
+
--
----
> cd C:\Development\wireshark
----
to jump into the source directory
--

[[ChToolsWin32Verify]]

==== Verify installed tools

After you've installed the Wireshark sources (see <<ChSrcObtain>>), you can
check the correct installation of all tools by using the `verify_tools` target of
the `Makefile.nmake` from the source package.

[WARNING]
.Dependencies ahead
====
You will need the Wireshark sources and some tools
(nmake, bash) installed, before this verification is able
to work.
====

Enter at the Visual Studio Command prompt line:

----
> nmake -f Makefile.nmake verify_tools
----

This will check for the various tools needed to build Wireshark:

----

Microsoft (R) Program Maintenance Utility Version 12.00.21005.1
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.


ERROR: The contents of 'E:\Wireshark\Wireshark-win32-libs\current_tag.txt' is (unknown).
It should be 2014-10-01.

Checking for required applications:

        sed: /usr/bin/sed
        unzip: /usr/bin/unzip
        wget: /usr/bin/wget
----

The "ERROR" at the start occurs because you haven't yet downloaded the third
party libraries and it can be ignored at this stage.
If you have problems with all the first three items (cl, link, nmake), check
that you opened a Visual Studio Command Prompt <<ChSetupPrepareCommandCom>>.

Unfortunately, the `link` command is defined both in Cygwin and in MSVC, each
with completely different functionality. You'll need the MSVC link. If your link
command looks something like: `/usr/bin/link` the link command of Cygwin takes
precedence over the MSVC one. To fix this, you can change your `PATH` environment
setting or simply rename `link.exe` in Cygwin. If you rename it, make sure to
remember that a Cygwin update may provide a new version of it.

Make sure that the other tools found are the Cygwin versions. Some build
problems have been caused by incompatible versions of `grep` and `unzip` provided by other installed applications.

==== Install Libraries

. If you've closed the Visual Studio Command Prompt <<ChSetupPrepareCommandCom,prepare>> it again.

. Run
+
--
----
> nmake -f Makefile.nmake setup
----
to download and install libraries using `wget`. This may take a while.
--

. If the download fails you may be behind a restrictive firewall. See the proxy
comment in <<ChToolsWget>>.

Note that 32-bit versions of the software require 32-bit versions of the
libraries and that 64-bit versions require 64-bit libraries. The build process
creates independent directories for each as needed. See
<<ChSetupPrepareCommandCom>>for how to open the required Visual Studio Command Prompt and
`WIRESHARK_TARGET_PLATFORM` to select either a 32- or 64-bit build.

==== Build Wireshark

Now it's time to build Wireshark!

. If you've closed the Visual Studio Command Prompt <<ChSetupPrepareCommandCom,prepare>> it again.

. Run
+
--
----
> nmake -f Makefile.nmake all
----
to build Wireshark.
--

. Wait for Wireshark to compile. This will take a while, and there will be a lot of text output in the command prompt window

. For the QT version run `C:\Development\wireshark\wireshark-qt-release\Wireshark.exe` and make sure it starts.

. For the older GTK version run `C:\Development\wireshark\wireshark-gtk2\Wireshark-gtk.exe`.

. Open 'Help -> About'. If it shows your "private" program
version, e.g.: Version wireshark-major-minor-version:[].x-myprotocol123
congratulations! You have compiled your own version of Wireshark!

TIP: If compilation fails for suspicious
reasons after you changed some source files try to "distclean"
the sources and make "all" again

==== Debug Environment Setup

You can debug using the Visual Studio Debugger or WinDbg.  See the section
on using the <<ChToolsDebugger, Debugger Tools>>.

==== Optional: Create User's and Developer's Guide

Detailed information to build these guides can be found in the file
'docbook\README.txt' in the Wireshark sources.

==== Optional: Create a Wireshark Installer

Note: You should have successfully built Wireshark
before doing the following.

If you want to build your own
'wireshark-win32-wireshark-major-minor-version:[].x-myprotocol123.exe',
you'll need NSIS.

. NSIS:
http://nsis.sourceforge.net[Download] and install NSIS
+
You may check the `MAKENSIS` setting in the file 'config.nmake' in the Wireshark
sources. Note that the 32-bit version of NSIS will work for both 32-bit and
64-bit versions of Wireshark.

. If you've closed the Visual Studio Command Prompt <<ChSetupPrepareCommandCom,prepare>> it again.

. Run
+
--
----
> nmake -f Makefile.nmake packaging
----
to build a Wireshark installer.
--

. Run
+
--
----
> C:\Development\wireshark\packaging\nsis\wireshark-win32-wireshark-major-minor-version:[].x-myprotocol123.exe
----
to test your new installer. It's a good idea to test on a different machine
than the developer machine. Note that if you've built an x64 version, the installer will be named accordingly.
--
