  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 1.99.1:
     * Qt port:
          + The welcome screen layout has been updated.
          + The Preferences dialog no longer crashes on Windows.
          + The packet list header menu has been added.
          + Statistics tree plugins are now supported.
          + The window icon is now displayed properly in the Windows
            taskbar.
          + A packet list an byte view selection bug has been fixed
            ([1]Bug 10896)
          + The RTP Streams dialog has been added.
          + The Protocol Hierarchy Statistics dialog has been added.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 1.99.0:
     * Qt port:
          + You can now show and hide toolbars and major widgets using the
            View menu.
          + You can now set the time display format and precision.
          + The byte view widget is much faster, particularly when
            selecting large reassembled packets.
          + The byte view is explorable. Hovering over it highlights the
            corresponding field and shows a description in the status bar.
          + An Italian translation has been added.
          + The Summary dialog has been updated and renamed to Capture
            File Properties.
          + The VoIP Calls and SIP Flows dialogs have been added.
          + Support for HiDPI / Retina displays has been improved in the
            official packages.
     * DNS stats: + A new stats tree has been added to the Statistics
       menu. Now it is possible to collect stats such as qtype/qclass
       distribution, number of resource record per response section, and
       stats data (min, max, avg) for values such as query name length or
       DNS payload.
     * HPFEEDS stats: + A new stats tree has been added to the statistics
       menu. Now it is possible to collect stats per channel (messages
       count and payload size), and opcode distribution.
     * HTTP2 stats: + A new stats tree has been added to the statistics
       menu. Now it is possible to collect stats (type distribution).

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 1.12.0:
     * The I/O Graph in the Gtk+ UI now supports an unlimited number of
       data points (up from 100k).
     * TShark now resets its state when changing files in ring-buffer
       mode.
     * Expert Info severities can now be configured.
     * Wireshark now supports external capture interfaces. External
       capture interfaces can be anything from a tcpdump-over-ssh pipe to
       a program that captures from proprietary or non-standard hardware.
       This functionality is not available in the Qt UI yet.
     * Qt port:
          + The Qt UI is now the default (program name is wireshark).
          + A Polish translation has been added.
          + The Interfaces dialog has been added.
          + The interface list is now updated when interfaces appear or
            disappear.
          + The Conversations and Endpoints dialogs have been added.
          + A Japanese translation has been added.
          + It is now possible to manage remote capture interfaces.
          + Windows: taskbar progress support has been added.
          + Most toolbar actions are in place and work.
          + More command line options are now supported

       routines) has been completely removed in favour of wmem which is
       now fully mature.
     * The (long-since-broken) Python bindings support has been removed.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   [2]https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be
   found on the [3]download page on the Wireshark web site.
     __________________________________________________________________

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
   files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations
   vary from platform to platform. You can use About->Folders to find the
   default locations on your system.
