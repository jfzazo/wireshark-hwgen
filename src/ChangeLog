    Qt: Add "Copy As..." to the Protocol Hierarchy stats.
    
    This implementation is slightly different compared to other dialogs
    since we have nested items.
    
    Tweak the bar highlight color look better on Windows while we're here.

    Use QNX_PC_ for QNX's pathconf parameter values.
    
    The numerical values are platform-specific, so call them QNX_PC_; that
    also avoids collision with the values on the platform on which we're
    building Wireshark (such a collision broke the Solaris build).

    TOS-specific forwarding blocks aren't actually required: don't warn when they

    Simplify the code a bit while also removing a proto_tree_add_text().  (There
    are a number of similar proto_tree_add_texts()s here.)
    
    Hang the "no forwarding blocks" expert info off the LSA item rather than off
    the Metric.  The warning is about how much data is in the LSA--it has
    nothing to do with the Metric.

    First, it appears some packagers actually ship a pkg-config file for Lua.
    Try to use it.  (Unfortunately the package name varies so we have to try
    several package names.)
    
    If that fails, try to find Lua directly, accounting for the various naming
    conventions we've seen.

    We need to get the pathname of the executable *before* running dumpcap.
    
    In order to find dumpcap, we need to get the pathname of the executable
    image, and we support -D in the first argument parsing loop, and that
    runs dumpcap to get the interface list, so we need to get the pathname
    of the executable image before that.

commit 9a3676a
Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 30 11:36:10 2015 -0800

    Qt: Clear our library path at startup on Windows.
    
    I recently rebuilt my Windows development VM and discovered that I could
    no longer run Wireshark executables from wireshark.org. Trying to do so
    failed with the following error:
    
    ----
    This application failed to start because it could not find or load the
    Qt platform plugin "windows".
    
    Available platform plugins are: minimal, offscreen, windows, windows.
    
    Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
    ----
    
    As it turns out there are two issues. According to
    http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html The search path
    for Qt plugins is hard-coded into the QtCore library. Dependency
    Walker confirmed this, showing that Qt5Core.dll tried to load
    C:\Qt\5.3\msvc2013_64_opengl\plugins\platforms\qwindows.dll instead of
    C:\Program Files\Wireshark\platforms\qwindows.dll.
    
    The second issue is that the Qt online installer only uses the major
    and minor version, e.g. C:\Qt\5.3. This means that you can end up with
    Qt 5.3.0, .1, .2, or .3 depending on *when* you run the installer.
    
    The Windows builders have 5.3.1 installed while my development VM
    has 5.3.2. Apparently qwindows.dll is not compatible between these two
    versions, hence the startup error. (...so what happens if you can create
    a malicious qwindows.dll which *is* compatible on someone's machine?)
    
    This change removes any entries from QCoreApplication::libraryPaths that
    don't match our executable path. This shouldn't be an issue in our case
    because both the NMake+QMake and CMake environments run windeployqt to
    copy in any required DLLs.
    
    If it *is* an issue or if clearing the library path list causes other
    problems I can reinstall Qt on the Windows builders into a unique and
    obvious path, e.g. C:\Qt-check-your-path-before-you-wreck-your-path\5.3

Date:   Wed Jan 28 01:47:31 2015 -0800

    Make the USB header information an enumerated type.
    
    It's not really a bitset, it's a choice of one of four types of USB
    pseudo-header.  Make it an enum.

    Move tests out of try_dissect_linux_usb_pseudo_header_ext().
    
    Do the tests in its callers; rename it to just
    dissect_linux_usb_pseudo_header_ext() and don't bother passing it the
    header_info flag.
    
    We can remove some of those tests as they're already done in the caller.

    gsm-rlcmac: use wmem_new0 for a struct
    
    Fixes "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value" from Valgrind.
    
    I couldn't really figure out how this code was supposed to function, it seems to
    initialize one member of the union and then expect *all* the others to just
    magically work (which they apparently do in most cases, oddly). The real bug
    could be in csnStreamDissector or who knows, but this at least turns "garbage
    data" into "zeros" which makes valgrind happy and turns a potential vuln into
    at worst a bad decoding.

    Replace "GIT" with "VCS" in make-version.pl and files it manipulates.
    
    That makes it more VCS-neutral - apparently some people maintain private
    versions under VCSes other than Git, and make-version.pl still handles
    those VCSes.

    Lua can free tvbuffs too early
    
    Lua-created tvbuffs should be kept around for the duration of pinfo's
    lifetime, instead of only for the duration of frame dissection. So
    instead of using the frame dissector's frame_end_routine, we'll register
    a callback to wmem for pinfo pool's allocator.

    RTPS: Memset entire buffer
    
    Apparently some compilers do sufficient inlining optimization to notice that
    there's at least one caller of rtps_util_add_typecode which passes an
    indent_level of 0. Such compilers are *also* picky enough to complain about
    memset being called with a length of 0, leading to a warning which we turn into
    a compile error.
    
    I thought about putting in an "if indent_level > 0" but I figure memsetting the
    entire buffer (length >= 1) is simpler and more efficient in the common case.

    Qt: Remove windowIcon property from our .ui files.
    
    Setting the windowIcon property in foo.ui means we end up with a
    setWindowIcon call in ui_foo.h. Along with setting the window title
    bar icon, it also sets the taskbar icon on Windows. A 16x16 PNG gives
    us a jaggy taskbar icon. (Windows ICO format is supported via a plugin
    which might not be available everywhere, otherwise we could try using
    a .ico resource.)
    
    Move the setWindowIcon call from ge990d1b to the top of the MainWindow
    constructor and enable it everywhere.

    Use luaL_{check,opt}integer() rather than luaL_{check,opt}int().

    It sounds as if the Lua developers are deprecating luaL_{check,opt}int():

    Remove a mysterious comment that no longer applies.
    
    There's nothing special about LUA_VERSION when it comes to the user
    overriding it - they'd do that by changing it, the same as with any
    other _VERSION variable.  Remove the comment about it, which is now out
    of date in any case.

    Only turn -msse4.2 on for ws_mempbrk_sse42.c, and don't always build it.
    
    Move all the SSE 4.2 stuff to wsutil/CMakeLists.txt.
    
    Don't put ws_mempbrk_sse42.c in WSUTIL_FILES by default; add it if we
    think the compiler supports compiling for SSE 4.2.
    
    Add -msse4.2 to its COMPILE_FLAGS, but don't add it to any other
    compiler flags - we don't want to build anything else with -msse4.2 by
    default, as the only code that uses SSE 4.2 instructions but *only* does
    so if the processor supports it is our mempbrk implementation.  (And

commit f215102
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Jan 20 16:29:06 2015 -0800

    Handle CFLAGS disabling SSE 4.2.
    
    When checking whether nmmintrin.h works, add -msse4.2 at the *beginning*
    of CFLAGS, so that user (or Gentoo build process) settings with
    -mno-sse4.2 override it.

    We *do* get the absolute path of the executable, so we *could* look for
    "run" right before the executable name.  The issue is that there's not
    the stronger libtool-imposed convention that the executable is in
    ".libs", so the chances of a false positive or false negative are
    higher.

    epl: Rework POWERLINK (EPL) dissector
    
     With this patch we want to enable a better support of POWERLINK
     as a protocol for people who have to perform network diagnostics using
     analyzing tools. Up until now, the main tool used was Omnipeek.
     Now wireshark will be used more and more, due to the new extcap
     infrastructure, which supports debug tools to be added as capture
     devices.
    
     To better facilitate that change, we have adapted the textual
     representation of the Omnipeek dissector for POWERLINK, as it
     allows for a faster and simpler diagnosis routine.
    
     Additionally the name of the protocol has been changed to it's
     correct name "POWERLINK" as this is the official name used by
     EPSG for describing the protocol.
    
    Changelog:
     - Add error code definitions and string values.
     - Change name for protocol column to POWERLINK which is more commonly
       used than EPL.
     - Reformat output in info column to look like output the output of
       the POWERLINK plugin for Omnipeek. This facilitates the transition
       to Wireshark. The added information and changed output improves the
       debugging of POWERLINK nerworks.

    JSON dissector changed into heuristic dissector.
    
    To check if a payload is json, the library libjsmn has been added to the source tree, with its licence (MIT).
    TODO: the libjsmn can be used to extract tokens in the standard dissection other than heurisitic part.
    
    HPFEEDS dissector has also been changed in order to leverage the new json dissector.

Date:   Tue Dec 23 18:32:34 2014 +1100

    TCAP: support dialogue confirmation
    
    TCAP permits the changing of the originating address on the first
    backwards continue (i.e. the establishment of the dialogue).
    See ITU-T Q.771 (06/97) clause 3.1.2.2.2.2 Confirmation of the dialogue.
    In practice, a BEGIN replied to with an END can also exhibit this behaviour.
    
    For example, a BEGIN from GT A TID TA -> GT B,
    and the reply CONTINUE from GT B2 TID TB -> GT A TID TA.
    To support this, only support a single address hash in
    tcaphash_begin_info_key_t and tcaphash_end_info_key_t.
    The match of the first CONTINUE should find the appropriate
    tcaphash_begin and create the appropriate tcaphash_end entries.
    
    Also fix compile warning with DEBUG_TCAPSRT.

commit cfcbb28
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Jan 18 02:22:19 2015 -0800

    Clean up ftype-conversion and dfilter error message string handling.
    
    Have dfilter_compile() take an additional gchar ** argument, pointing to
    a gchar * item that, on error, gets set to point to a g_malloc()ed error
    string.  That removes one bit of global state from the display filter
    parser, and doesn't impose a fixed limit on the error message strings.
    
    Have fvalue_from_string() and fvalue_from_unparsed() take a gchar **
    argument, pointer to a gchar * item, rather than an error-reporting
    function, and set the gchar * item to point to a g_malloc()ed error
    string on an error.
    
    Allow either gchar ** argument to be null; if the argument is null, no
    error message is allocated or provided.

commit e530c89
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Sun Jan 11 19:48:54 2015 -0500

    Replace se alloced memory in compare stat tap.
    
    Also replaced comments mentioning se_alloc memory with wmem_file_scope, since it's more accurate.
    
    It seems that many of the TShark stat taps may be leaking memory, because the hash tables created by the taps don't get a chance to be freed.  Somewhat academic since TShark exits shortly after displaying any stats, but a leak none the less.

    QT: stats_tree plug-ins not added to statistics menu
    
    Wireshark Qt does not add plug-ins that register with stats_tree_register_plugin() to the statistics menu in the ui (like the gtk version does).
    
    This patch dynamically adds all registered stats_tree plug-ins to the statistics menu.

    HTTP Dissector: Add CitrixAGBasic authentication
    
    Citrix uses a proprietary authentication schema called CitrixAGBasic for
    their StoreFront/Web Interface product.
    
    The Header looks like:
    Authorization: CitrixAGBasic username="dGVzdHVzZXI="; domain= \
           "dGVzdGRvbWFpbg=="; password="c2VjcmV0"; AGESessionId= \
           "YzI0NmRkMmFmYmE5ZTk5M2I5ZDRkN2UwYzYzZWExN2U="
    
    This patch enhances the HTTP dissector to decode this authentication data.
    
    Due to non-discolsure I can only provide a faked GET request as a pcap
    capture (attached to this bug).

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Jan 13 15:13:40 2015 -0800

    Consistently use the "g_string_free returns a C string pointer" idiom.
    
    g_string_free(str, FALSE) frees the GString container but not the
    underlying g_malloc()ed string; instead, it returns a pointer to the
    g_malloc()ed string.
    
    Fix those places that didn't already get the string pointer from
    g_string_free() to do so rather than manually extracting the string
    themselves.
    
    And fix one place that didn't even need to use a string - it was just
    scanning a C string without even modifying it.

    uat_load() and uat_save() return a success indication; use it.
    
    Instead of always ignoring the return value, always check it, and only
    report an error if it returns FALSE.

    UAT error string pointers should not be const pointers.
    
    UAT error strings are usually allocated by g_strdup() or
    g_strdup_printf(), and must ultimately be freed by the caller.
    
    Make the pointer-to-error-string-pointer arguments to various functions
    be "char **", not "const char **".
    
    Fix cases that finds where a raw string was being used, as that won't
    work if you try to free it; g_strdup() it instead.
    
    Add a missing free of an error string.
    
    Remove some no-longer-necessary casts.
    
    Remove some unnecessary g_strdup()s (the string being handed to it was
    already g_malloc()ated).
    
    Change some variable declarations to match.
    
    Put in XXX comments for some cases where the error string is just freed,
    without being shown to the user.

    When allocating address structures, use wmem_new0().
    
    For structures used as the data in an address, use wmem_new(), so that
    structure padding is zeroed out; the comparison code for addresses
    compares all bytes of the structure for addresses that are structures,
    and the hashing code for hash tables using addresses as keys hash all
    the bytes, so we have to make sure that, for addresses that are the
    same, *all* bytes are the same.

        The previous way didn't work for me.
    2.  Ensure /usr/bin is on the path if running under Cygwin.
        I really don't want Cygwin on my normal paths, the build process
        adds if required, so this change makes the test scripts do the same.

    gtk: fix crash on Broadway GDK backend
    
    The Broadway GDK backend does never sets event->string. This results in
    a crash when filter_string_te_key_pressed_cb tries to read its contents.
    
    Since the documentation marks reading the string as deprecated, try to
    handle the character conversion here. It is based on
    _gdk_x11_event_translate_keyboard_string (from gtk+), but without trying
    to interpret Escape as '\033', and without trying to convert control
    characters (example: Ctrl + 1). A buffer of 6 bytes is used to hold a
    UTF-8 code point (there is no zero terminator, so 7 bytes as found in
    the original implementation is unnecessary).
    
    As g_locale_from_utf8 returns dynamically allocated memory, change the
    control flow to have a single exit point where pointers are freed as
    needed.
    
    Reproduce with gtk3:
    $ broadwayd :5
    $ GDK_BACKEND=broadway BROADWAY_DISPLAY=:5 wireshark-gtk
    (now open http://localhost:8085/ and start typing in the display filter)
    
    Keys tested: e € (AltGr + 5) ü (AltGr + ", u)
    In the X11 backend, these still get displayed correctly. In the broadway
    backend however, the accents are missing due to a bug in the broadway
    implementation.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat Jan 10 16:26:46 2015 -0800

    Rename the FT_BYTES separator types to SEP_ from BASE_.
    
    There's no requirement for "display" field values to have names
    beginning with BASE_; use SEP_, to indicate that they're separators.
    
    (And, yes, we should introduce SEP_NONE, with a value of 0, and use it.)
    
    While we're at it, fix BASE_SEMICOLON - the separator is a colon, not a
    semicolon - and document SEP_SPACE in doc/README.dissector.

    disperse atalk-utils.[ch]
    
    The functionality was suiting for address_to_str.c and the #defines belong in packet-atalk.h.  Kept the address structure with the "address string conversion", but that can probably be better cleaned up when the address to str as a whole is cleaned up.
    
    Would also consider making AT_ATALK an FT_ type as well.

    Replace some ep_alloc and ep_alloc0 with its wmem equivalent.
    
    These cases were pretty easy to identify.  Also replaced some comments that referenced ep_alloced memory, when it's now in fact wmem_alloced.

    Add tvb_address_to_str.
    
    This is intended to handle ALL address types retrieved from a tvbuff.
    
    One of the (good) side effects of this function is that it can replace a lot of the "hidden" ep_alloc calls used to allocate memory for the address string.
    
    A few existing "popular" helper tvb_ functions were turned into pure macros calling tvb_address_to_str.  Some of the "less used" helper tvb_ functions were just directly replaced with tvb_address_to_str.

    No *pcap should have pcap_open() without the other remote extensions.
    
    WinPcap 3.0 introduced pcap_open(); it also introduced
    pcap_findalldevs_ex() and pcap_createsrcstr().  If you're going to put
    pcap_open() in libpcap, there's not much point to doing so but not also
    putting pcap_findalldevs_ex() and pcap_createsrcstr() there.
    
    (And, in the future, there'll be support for remote capturing with
    pcap_create() and pcap_activate(), with no need for pcap_createsrcstr(),
    and a replacement for pcap_findalldevs() and pcap_findalldevs_ex(),
    which we'll also check for.)
    
    So there's no need to check for pcap_findalldevs_ex() or
    pcap_createsrcstr().

    gtk: fix crash when moving columns
    
    When the columns are moved, the packet list is redrawn from the
    columns-changed signal handler. Apparently GTK does not like that the
    parent contains got destroyed.
    
    Call packet_list_recreate outside the callback to workaround this issue.
    Since the signal handler is blocked, it can never be called twice (and
    there will always be at most one packet_list_recreate_delayed
    scheduled).

    Create BASE_DOT, BASE_DASH, and BASE_SEMICOLON types for the FT_BYTES field type.

    Converted the "string" hf_ entries that used tvb_fc_to_str as a string to use proto_tree_add_item with FT_BYTES/BASE_DOT type.
    
    Converted applicable tvb_bytes_to_ep_str_punct() calls to use the new BASE values.

    Fix out-of-tree build includes of config.h
    
    If a file in the same directory as config.h, e.g. wireshark-qt.cpp
    has a #include "config.h", or another header it includes also has
    a #include "config.h", then an out-of-tree build, e.g. CMake will
    pick up any in-tree config.h and odd things may happen.  The correct
    form is #include <config.h> which will pick up the out-of-tree
    version.
    
    To find this, introduce a deliberate error and then make an out-of-tree
    build, noting where it fails and fix that file.  If that file includes
    other files that still cause the build to fail, set the compiler
    to emit the pre-processed version so you can locate the include with
    the next errant "config.h".  Repeat ad nauseum.
    
    Possibly all includes of "config.h" should be changed to <config.h>
    
    Revert "CMake: Clobber the top-level config.h before we build."
    
    This reverts commit 1f3849ce614aeae5fda742beffe5558e7c2a8b71.

    Remove the testing stuff.
    
    The problem was probably that we had two competing config.h files, with
    some source files including one of them and othe source files including
    the other, with the nmake config.h defining HAVE_KERBEROS and
    HAVE_MIT_KERBEROS and the CMake config.h defining neither, and with
    wireshark-qt.cpp including the nmake config.h, so that it expected there
    to be a read_keytab_file() routine, and
    epan/dissectors/packet-kerberos.c including the CMake config.h, so that
    it didn't define a read_keytab_file() routine.
    
    (If the CMake build is done out-of-tree, with its config.h file outside
    the source tree, and the nmake build done in-tree, with its config.h in
    the top-level source directory, wireshark-qt.cpp, in the top-level
    source directory, might pick up the config.h in the same directory, but
    epan/dissectors/packet-kerberos.c doesn't have a config.h in its source

    Due to the change in change-id Ib43e16a9d98d08e5ddaff81fd3235f5b64d7b95b, the setlocale() call has been moved earlier in tshark's processing, such that Lua plugins load with the environment locale instead of C-locale. Since that matches Wireshark's behavior, it's good, but it causes the Lua regex test suite to fail. So the test suite needs to be fixed.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Jan 1 15:05:25 2015 -0800

    Declare read_keytab_file() in epan/dissectors/packet-kerberos.h.
    
    Don't throw its declaration in file.h, as it's not defined in file.c.
    Instead, include it in epan/dissectors/packet-kerberos.h and include
    that wherever read_keytab_file() is called.
    
    Yes, that means you also have to include <epan/asn1.h> and, therefore,
    you have to include <epan/packet.h>.  Yes, that should be cleaned up,
    perhaps by splitting the Kerberos support code into "stuff that handles
    encryption keys without any reference to dissection" and "stuff that
    does dissection-related work".

    Lua: FieldInfo '==' check isn't really equality
    
    The FieldInfo metamethod for equality (letting you use the '==' operator)
    doesn't check for equality, but rather if the left-hand side is within
    the right-hand side. It should be equality instead. Also, all of the
    FieldInfo operate overloads should push a boolean even if they're false
    result.

    If the country_code or identification_code contain BCD digits > 9
    add an expert info warning.

    Get rid of packet data members of header structures.
    
    Instead, have a special macro using the size of the header structure to
    find the offset of the packet data.
    
    This means that:
    
    	1) you don't have to throw "-{size of data member}" into the
    	   macros that calculate the sizes of the header structures;
    
    	2) you don't have a bunch of randomly-chosen data field sizes;
    
    	3) you don't have sizes of 0, which cause problems with
    	   compilers that don't support zero-length arrays;
    
    	4) you don't have some apparently-incorrect "-{size of data
    	   member}" values (if they're correct, please fix the structure
    	   definitions).

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Dec 26 18:46:10 2014 -0800

    Don't use a leading - in getopt_long() option strings.
    
    The behavior of a leading - is platform-dependent.  It also means that
    non-option arguments are treated in a fashion that we're not handling,
    so capture filters given as non-option arguments at the end of the
    command line don't work.  (The Linux getopt() man page says that a
    leading - "is used by programs that were written to expect options and
    other argv-elements in any order and that care about the ordering of the
    two."  We are not such a program.)

    Use getopt_long() for the first pass through the argument list.
    
    That way:
    
    	1) we don't have to worry about the system getopt() and our
    	   getopt_long(), on platforms that have getopt() but not
    	   getopt_long() (Solaris prior to Solaris 10, HP-UX, AIX), not
    	   working well together;
    
    	2) if necessary, we can handle long options in the first pass.
    
    Switch to using getopt_long() for the *second* pass for the GTK+ version
    of Wireshark.
    
    Use the documented mechanism for resetting the argument parser for the
    glibc version of getopt_long(); use the mostly-undocumented-but-at-least-
    they-documented-optreset mechanism for the *BSD version.
    
    (We should look into doing only one pass, saving away arguments that
    can't fully be processed in the first pass for further processing after
    initializing libwireshark.)

Date:   Wed Dec 24 15:04:01 2014 -0500

    Bug 10233 - Wireshark crashes if Lua heuristic dissector returns true
    
    Because call_heur_dissector_direct() didn't set the pinfo->heur_list_name
    before calling the heuristic dissector, heur_dissect_lua() would invoke
    report_failure().  Unfortunately, calling report_failure() within a dissector
    can cause problems because GTK continues invoking timed callbacks while
    it displays the modal dialog created by report_failure()... without yet
    returning from report_failure().  In such a case, it's possible for
    epan_dissect_run() to be called while still within the execution of a
    previous call to epan_dissect_run(), which casues an assert since
    epan_dissect_run() is not reentrant.
    
    So this commit both fixes the call_heur_dissector_direct() bug as well
    as avoids using report_failure() within heur_dissect_lua().  It also
    upadtes the dissector.lua script used in the testsuite to match the one
    pubshied on the wiki, since that script's heuristic dissector triggered
    the bug.

    Add isValid, fileTitle, and retapPackets methods to CaptureFile. Add
    application name and title separator convenience methods to
    WiresharkApplication.
    
    Convert traffic tables, conversations, and endpoints to use CaptureFile
    directly and to let the user know when the capture file is closed. Set
    the file dialog titles while we're here.

Date:   Sat Dec 20 16:23:59 2014 -0500

    Cleanup use of #includes in non-generated epan/dissector/*.c
    
    Specifically:
    - Set packet.h to be the first wireshark #include after
       config.h and "system" #includes.
       packet.h added as an #include in some cases when missing.
    - Remove some #includes included (directly/indirectly) in
       packet.h. E.g., glib.h.
       (Done only for those files including packet.h).
    - As needed, move "system" #includes to be after config.h and
       before wireshark #includes.
    - Rework various #include file specifications for consistency.
    - Misc.

    (This means that there's no "udplite" heuristic dissector list, but
    there shouldn't be one - protocols can run atop UDP or UDPLite equally
    well, and they share a port namespace and uint dissector table, so they

    Don't bother with __builtin_floorl().
    
    At least as I read the GCC documentation, if GCC supports a builtin
    floorl() at all, it will always treat floorl() and
    __builtin_floorl() the same (it's reserved in C90 and defined in C99, so
    nobody should ever write C code assuming floorl() won't be treated in
    that afshion).
    
    In addition, the GCC 3.3.6 manual says nothing about __builtin_floorl(),
    so it probably won't help to use it.  If it appears to help, there's
    probably something else going on.
    
    Also, GCC appears not to like "#ifdef (__GNUC__)", as the parentheses
    mean it's testing an expression, not a macro name.

    Use ENCTYPE_NULL in the krb5_crypto_init() call.
    
    That appears to be a name supplied both by MIT and Heimdal Kerberos.
    Using it makes it a bit clearer what the code is doing, and might avoid
    type clash warnings if it's the right type (e.g., if it's a member of an
    enum, as it is in Heimdal, and the corresponding argument to
    krb5_crypto_init() is of the same type, the types will match).

    Removed attrID and cmdID ZCL cluster functions.
    Bug in ZCL HVAC attribute registration.
    Fixed bug in ZCL command ID field registration.
    Update Manufacturer Codes and Profile Ids to ZigBee-053874r26 Oct 2014
    Fixed broken fragmented ZigBee packet collection and reassembly
    Use protocol fields for Thermostat schedule transitions.
    Added support for Key Establishment Cluster (CBKE) at SE 1.2a
    Updated Message cluster to SE 1.2a spec
    Added attribute reporting status which is common to all SE 1.2a clusters
    Added SE 1.2a tunnel cluster support
    ZigBee Smart Energy (SE) decryption appears to have been broken for some time. For SE you do not know the Link Key until after successful completion of Key Establishment and then manually enter it into preferences. Entry in preferences was broken such that when the new Link Key was entered all existing link keys would be lost. This lead to the loss of the Network Key as well when the Transport Key message was re-processed without the Pre-Configured Link Key. The Link Key 'key ring' has been moved to the UAT post-update callback so that it will always be updated correctly after changes to the link keys in preferences
    The attribute reporting status attribute which is common to all SE clusters was accidentally shared, now each cluster has it's own instance
    ZigBee security added key display for decrypted packets
    ZigBee Security Preferences fixed UAT type for Label so key label is editable again
    Added definition for Retail Service profile
    Added dissection for profile-wide (General Command Frame) commands when the profile is unknown
    Added zbee-zcl-misc.c to precommit check whitelist as it contains ias and hvac clusters avoiding proliferation of too many small files

Date:   Fri Nov 28 15:52:07 2014 +0100

    http: properly calculate end of chunked response
    
    It was previously assumed that the remainder of a packet contains a
    chunked-body response. This does not have be the case, and if the
    assumption is violated, then the dissector would add multiple parts to a
    single "De-chunked entity body".
    
    This patch properly calculates the end of a chunked-body response,
    taking the optional trailer-part into account and adjusting the size of
    the chunked-body data as needed.
    
    The CRLF in last-chunk that was previously dissected as "Chunk Boundary"
    is the last CRLF that closes chunked-body, it is not part of last-chunk
    (as it has no chunk-data to terminate).
    
    A new header field is added for this trailer-part (RFC 7230 sec. 4.1).

    CMake: Make it easier to generate the release notes & NEWS.
    
    Add convenience targets for generating the release notes and the NEWS
    file. Make sure we don't run multiple instances of a2x + AsciiDoc at the
    same time.
    
    Add the docbook directory to the build by default unless we're running
    Windows. Explain why we don't yet build docs on Windows. Make each
    docbook makefile target optional.
    
    Split the ENABLE_GUIDES option into ENABLE_HTML_GUIDES and
    ENABLE_PDF_GUIDES. Add a default "all_guides" target if either is on.
    Remove the Debian patch that hacked around the PDF requirement.
    
    Copy ws.css to the docbook build directory. Don't build PDF release
    notes. I'm not sure we ever used them and I don't want to install Java
    and FOP just to make a release.
